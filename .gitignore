# It starts by ignoring all files and directories, then explicitly unignores
# specific paths, and finally re-ignores common build outputs, system files,
# and temporary files that might appear even within the unignored paths.

# Ignore everything by default
*

# Explicitly include specific files in the root directory
!DEPLOYMENT.md
!PRODUCTION-LINKS.md
!README.md

# Explicitly include the 'grade_calc' directory and all its contents
# !grade_calc/ is needed to ensure the directory itself is tracked,
# even if empty, or if Git needs to know about it before its contents are added.
# !grade_calc/** unignores all files and subdirectories recursively within 'grade_calc'.
!grade_calc/
!grade_calc/**

# Explicitly include the 'smooth_scrolling' directory and all its contents
# Similar logic as above.
!smooth_scrolling/
!smooth_scrolling/**

# Re-ignore common files that might be present even within explicitly included directories
# These rules apply globally and override any previous '!' inclusions for these specific patterns.
