# It starts by ignoring all files and directories, then explicitly unignores
# specific paths, and finally re-ignores common build outputs, system files,
# and temporary files that might appear even within the unignored paths.

# Ignore everything by default

# Explicitly include the 'grade_calc' directory and all its contents
# !grade_calc/ is needed to ensure the directory itself is tracked,
# even if empty, or if Git needs to know about it before its contents are added.
# !grade_calc/** unignores all files and subdirectories recursively within 'grade_calc'.
